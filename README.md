# React Learning Journey (Brocode Course)

This repository contains my progress and practice projects following the **Brocode React Course**. I am documenting my journey from basics to advanced concepts.

| **02 - Card-Component** | Creating reusable card components and styling. |
| **03 - CSS-Styles** | Inline CSS with Variables, External with .css files and Module CSS Import with "element.module.css". |

*(I will update this table as I add more projects)*

## 🚀 How to Run a Project

Since these are separate projects, you need to run them individually.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/taco0cat/React-Basics.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the specific project folder:
    ```bash
    cd "01 - Basic-React-App"
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
